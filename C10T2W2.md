## Article

The topic that all university students should study whatever they like or subjects which will be useful in the future is being discussed. Although each side of them have their own outlook , I suppose that all university students ought to study subjects that will be useful in the future.

As for subjects ~~which~~ students like ,students have various choose but these can't work well.  Firstly, students will not completely know about all their subjects , just choosing subjects which they think they like. They may find that some kinds of subjects which they study are not same as they consider. With ~~disappointed~~ <u>disappointment</u> , they can not concentrate on the subject. Secondly, if university students study too much subjects , they  would not get good grades in each one. Students are busy with a large quantity of subjects which means heavy school work . As a result , they do not know what they have learnt. So university students should not study  no matter what they like.

Studying useful subjects make them more professional in the future. First , in the compus , the undergraduates who just study subjects which suit for their job have a deep understanding of the technology        . Besides, they use almost whole four years to study subjects about their job. Accumulating a great deal of experience , they could solve the problems, happening in work, easily. This kind of undergraduates meet with great favor in companys. In short , university students who just study useful subjects are more capable than others.

In conclusion, students studying whatever they like will not have a great achievement than students studying useful subjects. So in my opinion, university students sould study the useful subject.
